  <P>
     My name is Ernest Kahia Irungu.I am eleven years old.I go to Light International School Primary.I live in Nairobi,Kenya.
     I was in Light Academy Kindergarten. I am an enthusiastic, self-motivated, reliable, responsible and hard working person. 
     I am a mature team worker and adaptable to all challenging situations. 
     I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own initiative. 
    I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines for important school projects.
  When I was seven years old Coronavirus had just hit its peak so my Parents had to buy me a laptop. 
When I got my laptop I started exploring what I could do with a laptop and thats when I discovered my love 
for computers and programming.Ever since then I have committed to study and make a living out of 
computer science.
